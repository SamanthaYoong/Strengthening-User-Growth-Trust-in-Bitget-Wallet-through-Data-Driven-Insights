## 1. ðŸ“Œ Context
Bitget Wallet, a multi-chain Web3 wallet, faces intense competition from players like **MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and OKX Wallet**.  
For Bitget to scale, it must:
- âœ… Reduce friction in onboarding and first transactions

- âœ… Anticipate market trends to capture growth in **DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi**  

**Role of a Business Analyst**:  
Empower product and business teams with insights, design monitoring frameworks, and propose **strategic growth recommendations**.

- Transaction anomalies (failed swaps, high slippage, gas spikes) **erode user trust**

- Segment Insights:  
  - **High-value users** (DeFi stakers, NFT traders): **70% retention @30 days**
